	<h1>KID OMEGA</h1>
	<div id='first'>
		<p>Nobody knows this character so I can write whatever I want, like he's from Yavne, works at Aroma and likes Sabich. He's named Omega becuase he was in Ninja Israel and fell from the omega. Otherwise there's nothing interesting about him.</p>

	<h1>HISTORY</h1>
	<div id='second'>
		<p>Omega made his first appearance in New X-Men #134 (Jan. 2003). His first appearance as Kid Omega and the first appearance of the Omega Gang were in New X-Men #135 (Feb. 2003). Grant Morrison has cited The Sekhmet Hypothesis as an influence on the story as well as Quire's angry punk rock aesthetic, referring to it in their book, Supergods.</p>
